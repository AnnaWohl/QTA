# QTA - Repository for Quantitative Text Analysis in Political Science

The repository is home of replication material for the paper "A Fourth Wave of Populism? Trajectories of Populist Parties in Europe" to be presented at the 11th ECPR General Conference in Oslo, Norway, 9 September 2017.

As an initial step, a methods paper is written, which will be posted here, along with data and replication code.
