## Repository for Quantitative Text Analysis (QTA) in Political Science

The repository is home of replication material for a project on the quantitative analysis of political text. The goals include measuring populism from diverse text sources such as election manifestos, speeches or tweets and to apply and advance methods of QTA while doing so. 

As an initial step, a paper project tests the capabilities of machine translation to bridge language barriers in the scaling of political texts, using the example of measuring populism.
