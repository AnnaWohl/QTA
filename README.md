## Repository for Quantitative Text Analysis (QTA) in Political Science

The repository is home of replication material for a project on the quantitative analysis of political text. The goals include measuring populism from diverse text sources such as election manifestos, speeches or tweets and to apply and advance methods of QTA while doing so. 

As an initial step, two paper projects are pursued. The first is a methods paper on the measurement of populism, which will be posted here, along with data and replication code. The second tests the capabilities of machine translation to bridge language barriers in the scaling of political texts.
