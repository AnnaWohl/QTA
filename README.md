## Repository for Quantitative Text Analysis (QTA) in Political Science

The repository is home of replication material for a project on the quantitative analysis of political text. The goals include measuring populism from diverse text sources such as election manifestos, speeches or tweets and to apply and advance methods of QTA while doing so. 

As an initial step, a methods paper on the measurement of populism with an application is written, which will be posted here, along with data and replication code.
