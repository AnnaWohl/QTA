## Repository for Quantitative Text Analysis (QTA) in Political Science

The repository is home of replication material for my projects on the quantitative analysis of political text. The goals include: 

- Measuring populism from diverse text sources such as election manifestos, speeches or tweets across languages using and advancing methods of QTA in several paper projects 
- Documenting methods of QTA and preparing them didactically in a textbook titled "" (contract with SAGE)
